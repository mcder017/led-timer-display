Race timers output to LED display boards using serial data, or by ethernet UDP 
using a similar serial data stream.  One protocol is the Alge display protocol.
This fork is intended to support modifying an off-the-shelf LED display board
to be driven by a Raspberry Pi (here, the Pi 3B+) to handle the protocol and
display information output from the off-the-shelf racing timer via a USB-to-Ethernet adapter
and connected to the Pi.
